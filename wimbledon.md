The Wimbledon Championships, commonly called Wimbledon, is the oldest tennis tournament in the world and
is widely regarded as the most prestigious.
It has been held at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, London, since 1877 and
is played on outdoor grass courts, with retractable roofs over the two main courts since 2019.
Wimbledon is one of the four major or Grand Slam tournaments, the others being the Australian Open,
the French Open, and the US Open.
It is the only major still played on grass, the traditional tennis playing surface.
It is also the only major that retains a night-time curfew, though matches can now continue until 23:00 under the lights.
